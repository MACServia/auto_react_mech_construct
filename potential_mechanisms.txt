Butadiene_Dimerization (7 elementary steps)

In conjunction with the Butadiene_Dimerization thermo library, this reaction library 
contains CBS-QB3 calculations for reactions relevant to Butadiene_Dimerization. 
Both calculations are done in CBS-QB3 level of theory. Specifics of the calculations 
performed: 1. CBS-QB3 Level of theory was used after a B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) geometry optimization 
was performed with frequency scale factor: 0.99 2. Frequency was calculated using B3LYP/CBSB7 iop(7/33=1) 
(Hessian was calculated) 3. 1D Hindered Rotors were calculated for steps of 10 
degrees up to the full 360 degree cycle, with geometry optimization on each step, 
using B3LYP/CBSB7 4. All files generated were fed to Arkane. 5. Bond additivity correction 
was not used for the rate calculation.
